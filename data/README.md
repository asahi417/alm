# Analogy Datasets
Analogy datasets are a collection of datasets for word analogy task. We compile five different datasets
into unified format, where you have a query relation pair `stem`, a list of candidate pairs `choice`, and the correct candidate
which is an analogy to the query pair.
We solit each dataset into validation and test set, and each of them is in jsonline, in which each line contains 
an entry.
